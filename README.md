# Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market

## Objective
To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in this project, we explore the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.
*Warning*: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.

## Project Tasks
1> Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies: Full dataset, filtering, and reproducibility </br>
2> Discard the cryptocurrencies without a market capitalization </br>
3> How big is Bitcoin compared with the rest of the cryptocurrencies? </br>
4> Making the plot easier to read and more informative </br>
5> What is going on?! Volatility in cryptocurrencies </br>
6> Well, we can already see that things are *a bit* crazy </br>
7> Ok, those are... interesting. Let's check the weekly Series too. </br>
8> How small is small? </br>
9> Most coins are tiny </br>
